# Effect Digital - Technical Test – Backend

In this technical test, you will create a RESTful endpoint using PHP and a framework of your choice. The objective is to develop an endpoint that accepts a PDF file and uses AWS’s Textract API to extract the text from a PDF.

The test assesses your ability to integrate with AWS services and demonstrate your proficiency in PHP development.

• Create a RESTful endpoint that accepts a Base64 Encoded PDF file, sends the input to AWS's Textract API (https://aws.amazon.com/textract) and stores the extracted text into a database table along with the time the request was made.

• Use PHP with any framework of your choice

• You can use any database system you're familiar with

• Unit tests should be added where appropriate

• Provide a sample PDF in the repository if you feel it would be beneficial

• You may use any code repository of your choice (E.g Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket). We would like to see regular commits to demonstrate your approach to the task.

• A README file must be provided which includes information about the project and instructions in how to use your endpoint.
